## ReadyTrader-Stocks Positioning

### What ReadyTrader-Stocks is (credible one-liner)
**ReadyTrader-Stocks is a safety-governed stock trading MCP server** that lets LLM agents (Agent Zero, Claude, etc.) research, paper trade, and (optionally) execute live trades via brokerage connectors with built-in risk disclosures, policy limits, and operator controls.

## Messaging pillars

### 1) Safety-first automation
- **Paper mode default** (`PAPER_MODE=true`)
- **Live trading opt-in** (`PAPER_MODE=false` + `LIVE_TRADING_ENABLED=true`; brokerage paper/sandbox accounts by default)
- **Kill switch** (`TRADING_HALTED=true`)
- **Approval mode** (`approve_each`)
- **Central policy engine** (allowlists/limits)

### 2) Agent-first UX
Tools return **structured JSON** with stable error codes, making it easier for agents to plan and recover.

### 3) Research & robustness
Built-in workflows for disciplined operators:
- backtesting
- synthetic stress testing
- market regime signals

### 4) Market data without keys
- `yfinance` prices and candles; no brokerage key needed to research or paper trade

### vs “Simple Stock APIs”
ReadyTrader-Stocks adds:
- trade governance (approval mode + kill switch)
- policy limits

- agent-friendly structured outputs
