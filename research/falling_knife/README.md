# Falling Knife study: reproduction harness

These scripts produced every number in `docs/FALLING_KNIFE.md` and the real-bar test fixtures in
`tests/fixtures/market_guard_real_bars.json`. They are research code, not part of the server: nothing
in `app/` or `core/` imports them.

Python 3.10+ standard library only; `fetch.py` also needs `curl`. Run everything from this
directory.

## Reproduce

```bash
bash fetch_all.sh                   # downloads daily bars into ./data/ (gitignored, ~95 MB)
python3 dev_v2.py equity 0.15,0.20,0.25          # development sweep -> results/dev_v2_equity.txt
python3 dev_v2.py fx 0.03,0.04,0.05,0.06,0.08    #                   -> results/dev_v2_fx.txt
python3 dev_crypto_v2.py                         #                   -> results/dev_v2_crypto.txt
python3 volhalt2.py                              # halt calibration  -> results/volhalt2.txt
python3 heldout_v2.py                            # frozen v2, scored -> results/heldout_v2.txt
python3 heldout_v2_crypto.py                     # frozen crypto v2  -> results/heldout_v2_crypto.txt
python3 heldout.py                               # frozen v1         -> results/heldout_v1.txt
python3 verify_module_v2.py equity|fx            # shipped module == research rule, every day
python3 make_fixtures.py stocks|fx <out.json>    # rebuild the test fixture
```

Yahoo revises history occasionally and the latest bars move every day, so a re-run months later
can differ slightly in the last decimal; the conclusions should not.

## Protocol

1. **Split first.** Development and held-out periods were fixed in `classes.py` before anything was
   scored: crypto 2022-01-01, equities 2020-01-01, FX 2017-01-01.
2. **Select on development years only**, with a rule written down in advance: the highest lift in
   P(a further severe drop within 10 days) among configurations firing on 0.3%-1.0% of
   instrument-days; ties within 0.2 lift go to the simpler rule.
3. **Freeze** the chosen configuration in a JSON file with its SHA-256 (`FROZEN*.json`). The scoring
   scripts refuse to run if the file has changed.
4. **Score once.**

The history, because it matters for how far to trust the numbers:

- **v1** (`FROZEN.json`) used a high-based drawdown (and, for crypto, an ATR-normalised one). It
  passed held-out for equities and FX and **failed for crypto** (lift 1.39: after big crypto drops
  the typical next ten days were a bounce).
- Yahoo FX daily bars turned out to carry bad high/low prints (0.24% of bars have a high more than
  3% above the open-close body). A high-based rule fires on those phantom spikes, so **v2**
  (`FROZEN_v2.json`) uses closes only. v2 was selected on the development years with the same rule.
  Because v1 had already been scored on the held-out years, those years are not pristine for v2,
  so v2 was also scored on **instruments first downloaded after v2 was frozen** (64 stocks,
  24 currency pairs). Those are the headline numbers.
- A close-based crypto rule (`FROZEN_v2_crypto.json`) was selected the same way, with a pass
  criterion written into the frozen file, and scored on 30 never-downloaded coins. It **failed**
  (lift 1.21 on the fresh coins' held-out years), so no price rule ships for crypto.

## Data notes

Equities: Yahoo daily bars, OHLC scaled by adjusted close / close so splits do not read as crashes;
index ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM) excluded from scoring. FX: Yahoo daily bars; every pair also scored
inverted (EURUSD and USDEUR), since either leg can be the one bought; USDCNY, USDARS and USDRUB
excluded (managed regimes or unreliable history); single-bar spikes over 8% that reverse over 6% the
next bar removed as bad ticks. Crypto: Binance public archive; LUNA clipped at 2022-05-28, when the
symbol was reused. Symbols Yahoo no longer serves (delisted: WBA, CMA, X) could not be downloaded, so
the equity universes carry survivorship bias.
