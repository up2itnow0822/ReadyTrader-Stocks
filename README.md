## 🌎 The Big Picture

**ReadyTrader-Stocks** is a specialized bridge that turns your AI Agent (like Gemini or Claude) into a professional stock trading operator. 

Think of it this way: Your AI agent provides the **Intelligence** (analyzing charts, earnings reports, and news sentiment), while ReadyTrader-Stocks provides the **Hands** (connecting to brokerages and data providers) and the **Safety Brakes** (enforcing your risk rules). It allows you to delegate complex trading tasks to an AI without giving it unchecked access to your capital.

## 🛡️ The Trust Model: Intelligence vs. Execution

The core philosophy of this project is a strict separation of powers:

*   **The AI Agent (The Brain):** Decides *what* and *when* to trade. It can research historical data, scan social media, and simulate strategies, but it has no direct power to move money.
*   **The MCP Server (The Guardrail):** Owns the API keys and enforces your safety policies. It filters every AI request through a "Risk Guardian" that rejects any trade that is too large, too risky, or violates your personal limits.

## 💰 Funding Model (Non-Custodial)

ReadyTrader-Stocks operates on a **User-Custodied** basis. This means:

*   **You keep your funds**: Your capital remains in your own brokerage account (e.g., Alpaca, Tradier, request Interactive Brokers).
*   **You control the keys**: You provide API keys that allow the agent to *trade* but (recommended) not *withdraw*.
*   **Agent as Operator**: The agent acts as a remote operator. It sends order instructions to your broker using your keys, and the broker handles actual execution and settlement.

> **Note**: In **Paper Mode** (default), we simulate a virtual wallet with fake funds so you can practice without linking a real brokerage.

## 🔄 A Day in the Life of a Trade

1.  **Research:** You ask your agent, "Find a good entry for AAPL." The agent calls `fetch_ohlcv` and `get_sentiment`.
2.  **Proposal:** The agent concludes, "AAPL is oversold; I want to buy $1000 worth of shares." It calls `place_market_order`.
3.  **Governance:** The MCP server checks its rules. Is $1000 within your `MAX_TRADE_AMOUNT`? If yes, it creates a **Pending Execution**.
4.  **Consent:** If you've enabled "Human-in-the-loop," the agent notifies you. You click **Confirm** in the [Web UI](#-optional-web-ui), and only then does the trade hit the market.

docker run --rm -i readytrader-stocks
```

### Local development (no Docker)
If you want to run or test ReadyTrader-Stocks locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python app/main.py
```

### 2. Configuration (`.env`)

## 🔌 Integration Guide

### Option A: Agent Zero (Recommended)
To give Agent Zero these powers, add the following to your **Agent Zero Settings** (or `agent.yaml`).
The MCP server key/name is arbitrary; we use `readytrader_stocks` in examples.

Quick copy/paste file: `configs/agent_zero.mcp.yaml`.

**Via User Interface:**
1.  Go to **Settings** -> **MCP Servers**.
2.  Add a new server:
    *   **Name**: `readytrader_stocks`
    *   **Type**: `stdio`
    *   **Command**: `docker`
    *   **Args**: `run`, `-i`, `--rm`, `-e`, `PAPER_MODE=true`, `readytrader-stocks`

**Via `agent.yaml`:**
```yaml
mcp_servers:
  readytrader_stocks:
    command: "docker"
    args: 
      - "run"
      - "-i" 
      - "--rm"
      - "-e"
      - "PAPER_MODE=true"
      - "readytrader-stocks"
```
Prebuilt config: `configs/agent_zero.mcp.yaml`.
*Restart Agent Zero after saving.*

### Option B: Generic MCP Client (Claude Desktop, etc.)
Add this to your `mcp-server-config.json`:

Quick copy/paste file: `configs/claude_desktop.mcp-server-config.json`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "readytrader_stocks": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", 
        "-i", 
        "--rm", 
        "-e", "PAPER_MODE=true", 
        "readytrader-stocks"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
Prebuilt config: `configs/claude_desktop.mcp-server-config.json`.

## 📚 Feature Guide

**Example Prompt:**
> "Create a mean-reversion strategy for AAPL. Write a Python function `on_candle` that uses RSI. Run a backtest simulation on the last 500 hours and tell me the Win Rate and PnL."

**What happens:**
1.  Agent calls `fetch_ohlcv("AAPL")` to see data structure.
2.  Agent writes code for `on_candle(close, rsi, state)`.
3.  Agent calls `run_backtest_simulation(code, "AAPL")`.
4.  Server runs the code in a sandbox and returns `{ "pnl": 15.5%, "win_rate": 60% }`.

### 2. Paper Trading Laboratory (Zero-Key Flow)
Perfect for "interning" your agent without any paid API keys.
*   **Fund your account**: `deposit_paper_funds("USD", 100000)`
*   **Researching Stocks**: Use `fetch_ohlcv` and `get_stock_price` (powered by public `yfinance` data).
*   **Analyze Sentiment**: `fetch_rss_news` (MarketWatch/Yahoo Finance) provides real-time "Free" signals.
*   **Place Orders**: `place_market_order("AAPL", "buy", 10)`
*   **Reset Everything**: `reset_paper_wallet()`

### 3. Market Regime & Risk
The agent can query the "weather" before flying.
*   **Tool**: `get_market_regime("AAPL")`
*   **Output**: `{"regime": "TRENDING", "direction": "UP", "adx": 45.2}`
*   **Agent Logic**: "The market is Trending Up (ADX > 25). I will switch to my Trend-Following Strategy and disable Mean-Reversion."

**The Guardian (Passive Safety):**
You don't need to do anything. If the agent tries to bet 50% of the portfolio on a whim, `validate_trade_risk` will **BLOCK** the trade automatically.

It also refuses a **BUY into a collapse**: a stock down 15%+ from its highest close of the last four sessions and still at its lowest close. The rule, the data it reads and the evidence behind the threshold (tested on 64 stocks it had never seen) are in [`docs/FALLING_KNIFE.md`](docs/FALLING_KNIFE.md).

*Built for the Agentic Future.*

## 🧪 Synthetic Stress Testing
This MCP includes a **100% randomized (but deterministic-by-seed)** synthetic market simulator. It can generate trending, ranging, and volatile regimes and inject **black swan crashes** and **parabolic blow-off tops**.

### Tool: `run_synthetic_stress_test(strategy_code, config_json='{}')`
Returns JSON containing:
- **metrics summary** across scenarios
- **replay seeds** (master + per-scenario)
- **artifacts**: CSV scenario metrics, plus worst-case equity curve CSV + trades JSON
- **recommendations**: suggested parameter changes (and applies to `PARAMS` keys if present)

Example `config_json`:
```json
{
  "master_seed": 123,
  "scenarios": 200,
  "length": 500,
  "timeframe": "1h",
  "initial_capital": 10000,
  "start_price": 100,
  "base_vol": 0.01,
  "black_swan_prob": 0.02,
  "parabolic_prob": 0.02
}
```
